# Most Likely To

This project aims to implement a fun and intuitive room-based "Who's Most Likely To" game. Currently, it is very basicâ€”for the most part, the server is just a way for clients to talk to each other. Both the client and the server are written in TypeScript and use socket.io to communicate. The client uses React with styled-components for styling and react-spring for animations (I have yet to work on transitions).
